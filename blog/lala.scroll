I'm selling my copy of the _La La Land_ script signed by Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. 100% of proceeds will go to Cancer Research and 100% of proceeds will go to paying artists to create public domain mp3s for this website, Music Of a People.

? Wait, doesn't that add up to 200%?
Yes. I will personally provide the matching funds.

# La La Land tied for the most nominated movie in Oscar History (14 nominations, 6 wins)
