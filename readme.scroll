? What do we believe?
- We believe in music.
- We believe in artists.
- We believe music is best experienced live.
- We believe vinyl is better than digital.
- We believe digital music should have no (c)hains attached.

? How do I make music for Music of a People?
- Email us with your public domain songs.
- If we love them we'll reply with a one time offer. We may even offer to pay for a few months so you can focus on doing your best work. We'll let you know either way.
- We don't believe in exclusive deals and since your files are public domain you can do whatever the fuck you want with them.
- In the future, we may expand to do more traditional publisher things inlcuding help you with concerts, vinyl record sales, merchandise, etc.
- We will not sell mp3s or use any kind of DRM â€” fans come first and no fans want that. We want to make money together in the real world. Digital is just for spreading the word about you and your music.
